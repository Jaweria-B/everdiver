evernote does not offer the possibility to analyze the collected notes. python can be used to access the local evernote database and analyze the information it contains.

## analyze evernote data
- [ ] show areas of expertise
- [ ] display the depths of knowledge in each corresponding field (beginner vs expert)
- [ ] show time course of creating/updating notes in each knowledge field
- [ ] visualize connection between notes
- [ ] identify missing knowledge comparing to outside databases
